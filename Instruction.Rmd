# Overview

This document provides instructions for cloning, running, and deploying the Political Terror Scale (PTS) Trend Dashboard Shiny app. Follow the steps below to set up and run the app locally, and deploy it to ShinyApps.io if needed.

## 1. Clone the Repository

To begin, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohsnmonji/Trend-in-Average-Political-Terror-Scale.git
```

## 2. Install Necessary R Packages

Before running the app, you need to ensure that the required R packages are installed. You can install the necessary packages by running the following R code:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

These packages are essential for the Shiny app, data manipulation, and plotting.

## 3. Set Working Directory

Set your R working directory to the location where you cloned the repository. You can do this by running the following code in R:

```r
setwd("/path/to/PoliticalTerrorScale")
```

Replace `"/path/to/PoliticalTerrorScale"` with the actual path to the cloned repository on your system.

## 4. Run the App Locally

After setting the working directory, you can run the app locally using the `shiny::runApp()` function in R. This will launch the app in your web browser.

```r
shiny::runApp('PTS_Trend_Code.R')
```

This command will start the Shiny app, allowing you to explore Political Terror Score trends interactively on your local machine.

## 5. Deploying the App on ShinyApps.io

If you want to deploy the app to ShinyApps.io for public access, follow these steps:

### 5.1 Set Up ShinyApps.io Account

First, set up your ShinyApps.io account with the following R code. Replace `'your_username'`, `'YOUR_TOKEN'`, and `'YOUR_SECRET'` with the appropriate account details, which you can obtain from the ShinyApps.io dashboard.

```r
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name = 'your_username', token = 'YOUR_TOKEN', secret = 'YOUR_SECRET')
```

### 5.2 Deploy the App

Once your account is configured, deploy the app with the following command:

```r
rsconnect::deployApp(appDir = getwd())
```

This command will upload and deploy the Shiny app, making it accessible to anyone with the link to your ShinyApps.io page.

## 6. Accessing the Deployed App

The app van be accessed at:

[https://mohsnmonji.shinyapps.io/PTS_Trend/)

## Troubleshooting

- If the app does not run, ensure all necessary R packages are installed and the dataset `PTS-2024.csv` is located in the correct directory.
- For issues with deployment, verify that your ShinyApps.io account details are correct and you have sufficient space and resources on your account.
