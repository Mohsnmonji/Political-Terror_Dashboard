# Overview

This document provides instructions on the R source code for the Political Terror Dashboard. The purpose of this document is to outline how to access and understand the code. For those interested in exploring the code or making contributions, follow the steps below.

## 1. Access the Source Code

The source code for the Political Terror Dashboard can be found in the GitHub repository. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohsnmonji/Political-Terror-Dashboard.git
```

This repository contains all necessary files, including the R scripts and data used to build the dashboard.

## 2. Key R Packages

The app relies on the following R packages, which must be installed to run the code locally:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

These packages are essential for Shiny app development, data manipulation, and plotting.

## 3. Main Files and Structure

The key files in the repository are:

- **PTS_Trend_Code.R**: The primary R script for running the Shiny app. This script contains the UI and server logic for generating the dashboard.
- **PTS-2024.csv**: The dataset used by the app to display trends in Political Terror Scale scores.

## 4. Running the App for Development

To modify or explore the app code, set your working directory to the cloned repository and run the app locally in R:

```r
setwd("/path/to/Political-Terror-Dashboard")
shiny::runApp('PTS_Trend_Code.R')
```

Replace `"/path/to/Political-Terror-Dashboard"` with the actual path to the cloned repository on your machine.


By following these steps, you can access and modify the PTS Trend Dashboard's source code for research, learning, or development purposes.

## 5. Contribution

If you wish to contribute to the development of the app, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your enhancements or bug fixes. You can also raise issues or suggestions directly on the GitHub page.
